## 🌐 Project Info

**Live URL**: [https://phygital-store.vercel.app/](https://phygital-store.vercel.app/)

A next-generation **PHYGITAL (PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL) shopping app** Every single time someone walks into a supermarket or hypermart and wishes the experience was as smooth, personalized, and intelligent as online shopping—but without losing the physical experience. <br>
**Why does our project matter —** Online shopping is smart but not immediate · Offline shopping is immediate but lacks intelligence · personalization · and comfort · Customers deserve the best of both worlds
